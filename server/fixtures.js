			{name: 'VRV Systems', desc: '<div><b>Variable Refrigerant Volume Systems</b></div><div><br></div><div>The variable refrigerant volume systems (VRV/VRF) is basically a large multiple split system. The system can comprise of several indoor fan coil units, matched to one or more outdoor condensing units.</div><div><br></div><div>The VRV / VRF systems can achieve high efficiencies through heat recovery and accurate temperature control. This is achieved with the use of inverters and electronic controls. The systems are split into two basic forms...</div><div><br></div><div>Two pipe heat pump systems</div><div>The two pipe inverter VRV / VRF system is very similar to the multi system explained in the split system section. The system will consist of several indoor units that can be of different types and sizes. The indoor units are served by one or more outdoor condensing units, all using one common refrigerant pipe work system.</div><div><br></div><div>The two pipe system can only run in one mode of operation, heating or cooling. This means that all units can only control when in the same mode. However, the system does allow the individual setting of each fan coil unit within the selected mode.</div><div><br></div><div>The two pipe heat pump VRV / VRF system is suitable for large open plan areas, or areas that only require to be within the same mode at once (heating or cooling). The use of inverters within the outdoor condensing unit allows the system to perform only the required amount of heating or cooling, thus saving energy all round...</div><div><br></div><div>Three pipe heat recovery systems</div><div>The three pipe VRF heat recovery system is similar in configuration to the two pipe system above. Multiple indoor units are connected to one or more outdoor units via one set of refrigeration pipe work. The three pipe system uses three separate pipes rather than two (as the name suggests) between all units connected.</div><div><br></div><div>The three pipe system allows total individual control for each indoor unit. The indoor units can be set in individual modes in any combination. The system also has the ability to recover heat from one area and pass it to another or vice versa. This heat recovery process makes a very efficient system, if designed and installed correctly.</div><div><br></div><div>For example take a large busy office containing a large amount of computer equipment. The office requires cooling to make the area comfortable for the operators within. A three pipe system is installed to carry out the cooling requirements. The system also serves a number of smaller individual offices. The smaller offices require heating. The three pipe system now has the ability to pass the heat absorbed from the main office to the smaller offices as required, and vice versa. Thus the system recovers heat.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Gas powered VRV / VRF systems</b></div><div><br></div><div>Where the amount of electrical supply is limited and a gas supply is available, gas powered VRF systems can be used. The gas powered VRF system uses a gas powered internal combustion engine in place of the electric compressors in the standard systems.</div><div><br></div><div>The gas powered units have the advantage of reclaiming waste engine heat, when in the heating mode.</div><div><br></div><div>Units are also available that will heat hot water and generate electrical power at the same time. These systems have been installed where it is uneconomical to uprate the building electrical power supplies.</div><div><br></div><div>The systems can also now have the ability to provide additional services such as small power generation and domestic hot water.</div>', department: ac._id, slug: URLify2('VRV Systems')},

		{title: 'Reasons Why Your Air Conditioner May Be Leaking', tip: 'When refrigerant levels get low, either through a leak or some other problem, frost can form on the evaporator coils. When the frost melts, it can create pools of water on the ground. This is a problem because the frost insulates the refrigerant from the air its supposed to cool, as well as lower cooling capacity overall. Cleaning the ice up doesnt solve the problem. A technician needs to seal the leak and recharge the refrigerant before it will work again.'},
		{title: 'Reasons Why Your Air Conditioner May Be Leaking', tip: 'Most air conditioners have a drip pan to collect condensate and remove it from the system. When the line gets clogged, the pan will overflow and dripping water may result. This can damage pother nearby components, especially electrical ones, which is why it needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.'},
		{title: 'Change Your Air Filter Regularly', tip: 'Your air filter removes many types of harmful contaminants from the air that passes through your ductwork. When your filter is dirty it is unable to effectively remove contaminants from your air, which leads to poor indoor air quality. Inspect your filter every month and change it if you cant see through to the other side when you hold it up to a light. As a general rule, you should change the filter at least every other month.'},
		{title: 'Seal Air Leaks', tip: 'Most homes have air leaks that allow precious, filtered and cooled air to escape and warm air to enter the home. The result of air leaks is that your AC has to work harder to replace that lost cool air. This added work not only increases the wear and tear on your system, leading to breakdowns and a shorter life span, but also to significantly higher energy bills.'},
		{title: 'Clean and Insulate Ductwork', tip: 'A large volume of air passes through your ductwork anytime you run your AC. When your ductwork is dirty, it can impede air transfer and make your AC work harder, again leading to higher energy bills and more wear and tear. Secondly, ductwork that isnt insulated will be exposed to heat before it reaches its destination.'},
		{title: 'Misplaced pan', tip: 'If your pan is misaligned or missing somehow, then the condensate will drip onto the floor of the unit, creating the same conditions outline above. A technician will need to rest or replace the pan before the water causes any damage.'},
		{title: 'Time To Replace your AC?', tip: 'Most air conditioners have an average lifespan of 10-15 years. After 10 years, the rate at which parts and components break or malfunction begins to increase. Operating your air conditioner with aging parts and components can result in far worse damage and worsen existing wear-and-tear.'},
		{title: 'Time To Replace your AC?', tip: 'As with any mechanical device, you can expect to pay for air conditioning repairs at some point. But if you are calling frequently for repairs, it may be time to consider replacement. Repairs can add up, and enough repairs can add up to the cost of a new system.'},
		{title: 'Spike in Utility Bills', tip: 'You probably have a good idea of what to expect for each month’s energy costs, especially if your cooling habits stay relatively even. If you see a big jump in your monthly energy costs, and there isn’t an existing problem with your AC or a price increase from the power company, your system may be struggling to supply the amount of cooling you need. When this happens, it uses more energy and your energy bills go up.'},
		{title: 'Warmer At Night Is OK', tip: 'During the night time hours you dont require the same level of conscious cool. Try turning your AC down (so it is running less) during your sleep hours or an hour or two before bed.'},
		{title: 'Use Window or Portable Units', tip: 'If you arent into cooling your whole home, try using a portable unit to cool just the area youll be working in. They use up to 50% less energy than a larger central air unit would to cool off the same space.'},
